# F.O.O.T.B.A.L.L. II C.O.N.S.T.I.T.U.T.I.O.N.
Thank you for your interest in the Franchise Owner's Organization to Battle America's Lackadaisical Leagues II and welcome to our Codified Ordinance Noting Simple Traditions Intelligently Transcribed Utilizing Tautological Intrinsic Outlandish Nomenclature.

## Summary
This will attempt to summarize rules. If the summary does not agree with the detailed information in the appendix, the appendix is correct.

### Startup
1. Rookie draft determined randomly and will be third-round reversal draft. See [Startup Rookie Draft](#startup-rookie-draft)
2. Free agent draft will be auction draft and take place live for 10 rounds and then proceed online, blind bidding on up to 10 players per day.
3. If you run out of money when processing blind bids to process a certain bid, you're highest value bids that you can afford will be prioritized.
4. If you run out of money completely during the blind bids, you will not be able to nominate players.

### Rookie Draft
1. Draft order determind by final standings of previous season (See [Rookie Draft Pick Orders](#rookie-draft-pick-orders)):
   - For 1, 2, 3, and 4 finishers, winner assigned pick 10, runner up pick 9, etc.
   - For 5 and 6 place finishers, highest potential points assigned pick 6 and other assigned pick 5.
   - For everyone else, most potential points assigned pick 4, etc.
2. Prices will be determined based on draft order. See [Rookie Draft Prices](#rookie-draft-prices)

### Free Agent Draft
1. Time allowing, everyone will have at least 7 days of end of free agent draft to get contracts in. Official date will be known at that time.
2. We'll see how slow startup draft goes before deciding future. They are all pretty demanding and hard to deal with schedules, so if slow draft goes well then we'll probably bring it back. Perhaps with modified rules.

### Playoffs
1. Playoffs begin in week 14 and conclude in week 17.

### Transition Tags
 - Each team may assign a transition tag to up to 2 players each season
 - Players receiving a transtion tag must have a contract ending before the next season and must have been on the team's roster to end the regular season
 - Owners must declare transition tags before 3/1 and may reverse their decision before 3/1
 - Players designated for a transition tag will receive a 1 year contract and must become free agents after that 1 year
 - Costs determined as the [average of the highest paid players at their position](#position-tiers) or current salary + 10% - whichever is higher. Average salary is always calculated on contracts as they exist exiting the free agent draft.

### Holdouts
 - Players may not holdout if:
   - They are a rookie on the first or second year of their contract
   - They are on the first year of a four year contract
   - They are on the first or second year of a five your contract
 - Players that may hold out will if, at the end of the complete fantasy season (through the championship game), they finish in the [top tier of their position](#position-tiers) (this means scoring more points than the average of those top tiers) and they are paid less than 50% of the average salary for the players paid in the [top tier of their position](#position-tiers).
 - Players who holdout must be (1) cut, suffering normal contract penalties based on their previous contract or (2) have their salary increased to 75% of the average for the players paid in the [top tier of their position](#position-tiers).

### Extensions
 * Players may have their contract extended one time.
 * Extensions increase a players salary by 10% or to $10 - whichever is more.
 * Players on the final year of their contract must be extended before the extension deadline, 3 weeks before week 1 games begin
 * Rookies on the final year of their contract may be extended after the extension deadline if they are being promoted from the taxi squad and extended within 24 hours of being promoted.

### Taxi Squad
1. Players acquired during the rookie draft are automatically assigned a 3 year contract and placed on the team's taxi squad.
2. The rookie draft and trading for rookies already on a taxi squad are the only way to add players to a team's taxi squad.
3. Players on a taxi squad only have 25% of their salary count toward the team's salary cap (eg, a $60 players costs $15)
4. On same day contracts are due (time allowing, at least 7 days after free agent draft), teams must reduce their taxi squad to no more than 5 players. This can be done through cuts, activations, or trades.
5. Players on the taxi squad may be cut for no penalty.
6. Taxi squad players may be stolen. There will be a message board post for this with details on how to initiate activating a player from someone else's taxi squad. The cost is 2 picks - one must come from the same round the player was drafted in, or better, and the other must come from a better round (eg, you can't steal a first round pick. A second round pick costs a first and a second or two firsts)
7. Owners have the right to match an offer on their own taxi squad player, preventing them from being stolen. Preventing the steal must be done within 24 hours of the activation.
8. Taxi squad players may not be stolen after the trade deadline

### Trades
1. No collusion ;-)
2. Teams may trade players, draft picks for the current season, and draft picks for the next season.
3. All trades must be completed before the trade deadline.

### Injured Reserve
 * Each team has 4 injured reseve slots.
 * Players that the league software allows to be placed on IR (likely OUT, SUSPENDED, and IR).
 * Players placed on IR must remain on IR for at least 28 days.
 * Only 25% of a player's salary counts against the current season salary cap while they remain on IR
   * Returning from IR or dropping the player has the salary return to normal

### Rosters
 * Teams have 25 roster spots
 * Starting rosters are 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, and 3 FLEX
 * In addition to the 25 roster spots, teams have 4 [Injured Reserve](#injured-reserve) spots and 5 [Taxi Squad](#taxi-squad) spots

### Scoring
Pretty standard 0.5 PPR. See [scoring details](#scoring-details)

### Waivers
 * Teams may use their unspent salary for blind bidding on free-agents during waivers
 * Link to leaague software's waiver bidding will be made available or it will be described here and distributed to the league.
 * FAAB claims will be processed every Thursday morning at 3 AM Central and every Sunday morning at 3 AM Central (dependant on league software)
 * Free agents are always on waivers except while processing waiver bids
 * Players acquired from waivers 
 * Contract length must be posted within 48 hours of aquiring the player. If no length is posted, it will default to 1 year.
 * The waiver window begins 1 month before the first regular season game.
  * If contracts are not due before this, then waivers will open after contracts are due.
 * Waivers close as soon as the week 17 games begin

### Bureaucracy
#### Commissioner
1. At the beginning of each season, the commissioner will be held over from the previous season.
2. During the season, the commissioner will be responsible to efficiently run the day-to-day operations of the league and will be required to interpret the appropriate course of action based on the terms outlined in the league Constitution and the league software.
#### Triumvirate
#### Amendments

### Special Considerations
1. If a game is not finished similar to 2022's Buffalo / Cincinnati game in week 17, we will defer to the league software's ruling. If that is not conclusive, we will defer to the NFL's ruling. If that is not conclusive, the game will be a draw.

## Appendix

### Startup Rookie Draft
 - A random number, 1-10 will be assigned to each team. Team 1 gets to determine their pick position first, then Team 2, etc. **These are not franchise numbers assigned based on order teams join the league**
   - Each team has a day to determine their pick order. If they don't, then they will be assigned the earliest pick available and then we will move on to the next team.
     - Eg, if Team 1 decides they want pick 10 (so they get 1.10, 2.01, 3.01, 4.10, and 5.01) on Monday, then Team 2 has all day Tuesday to decide. If they don't choose, then they get pick 1. If they do choose pick 1 on Monday, then Team 3 has all day Tuesday to decide. If they don't choose before Wednesday, then they would get pick 2
     - The first day for this selection will be decided after the order is chosen. There will be at least 24 hours for Team 1 to decide.
 - Third-round-reversal is like a snake draft, but changes direction after round 2 / before round 3. More specifically, if we pick in order of Team 1 - Team 10:

   | Round | Pick 1  | Pick 2 | Pick 3 | Pick 4 | Pick 5 | Pick 6 | Pick 7 | Pick 8 | Pick 9 | Pick 10 |
   |-------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
   | 1     | Team 1  | Team 2 | Team 3 | Team 4 | Team 5 | Team 6 | Team 7 | Team 8 | Team 9 | Team 10 |
   | 2     | Team 10 | Team 9 | Team 8 | Team 7 | Team 6 | Team 5 | Team 4 | Team 3 | Team 2 | Team 1  |
   | 3     | Team 10 | Team 9 | Team 8 | Team 7 | Team 6 | Team 5 | Team 4 | Team 3 | Team 2 | Team 1  |
   | 4     | Team 1  | Team 2 | Team 3 | Team 4 | Team 5 | Team 6 | Team 7 | Team 8 | Team 9 | Team 10 |
   | 5     | Team 10 | Team 9 | Team 8 | Team 7 | Team 6 | Team 5 | Team 4 | Team 3 | Team 2 | Team 1  |

### Startup Free Agent Draft
 * First 10 rounds will be "live" (everyone bidding against eachoter in some online chat thing). Rotate through teams nominating who they want bidding to be on.
 * Rest of rosters will be filled through slow blind bids. I envision making a website for this where everyone submits a player and their opening bid. Then, the next day, you find out all the players nominated and bid accordingly while submitting your players for the next day.
   * May be optimistic and I create an email account to send bids and players to so I don't see them until processing them.
 * You will be allowed to modify your bids until midnight
 * If any significant news comes out about a player during the day of their bidding, all bids on that player will be void and they will be included in bidding the next day with a starting bid of $0 to nobody
   * If nobody bids on them they will just go back into the pool
   * What's significant news? Injuries, Suspensions.
 * Ties will be decided by a standard waiver order. Initial waiver order will be reverse of the rookie draft (may want to consider this when picking where you draft).
 * Two players nominating the same player will??
 * For the non-live part of this, winning bid will be second place bid plus $1.


### Rookie Draft Pick Orders
 - 1st place is assigned pick 10 in the next season
 - 2nd place is assigned pick 9 in the next season
 - 3rd place is assigned pick 8 in the next season
 - 4th place is assigned pick 7 in the next season
 - 5th and 6th place are assigned picks 5 and 6. Team with highest potential points is assigned pick 6 while the other team is assigned pick 5
 - Everyone else is assigned picks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Team with highest potential points is assigned pick 4, next highest is assigned pick 3, next highest is assigned pick 2, and fewest is assigned pick 1.
 - Please note, the third-round-reversal is ***only*** for startup. Future rookie drafts are straight up drafts, like NFL rookie draft.

### Rookie Draft Prices
| Round | Pick 1 | Pick 2 | Pick 3 | Pick 4 | Pick 5 | Pick 6 | Pick 7 | Pick 8 | Pick 9 | Pick 10 |
|-------|------- |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1     | $60    | $50    | $50    | $50    | $40    | $35    | $35    | $30   | $30     | $30     |
| 2     | $20    | $20    | $20    | $20    | $20    | $15    | $15    | $15   | $15     | $15     |
| 3     | $10    | $10    | $10    | $10    | $10    | $10    | $10    | $10   | $10     | $10     |

| 5     | $1     | $1     | $1     | $1     | $1     | $1     | $1     | $1    | $1      | $1      |
    
### Position Tiers
 - This is used for determining average points or average salaires as apporpiate. Eg, if Aaron Rodgers was paid $500 and he was the highest paid quarterback and didn't play at all, he would count in the top 5 for salary and not in the top 5 for points.

   | Tier   | Position(s) |
   |--------|-------------|
   | Top 5  | QB, TE      |
   | Top 7  | RB          |
   | Top 10 | WR          |

### Scoring Details
 * 4 points per passing TD
 * 0.05 points per passing yard
 * 0.25 points per pass completion
 * -2 points per interception thrown
 * -1 point for being sacked
 * 1 point per passing 2 point conversion
 * 6 points per rushing TD
 * 0.1 points per rushing yard
 * 2 points per rushing 2 point conversion
 * 6 points per receiving TD
 * 0.1 points per receiving yard
 * 0.5 points per reception
 * 2 points per receiving 2 point conversion
 * -0.5 points per fumble
 * -1.5 points per fumble lost (to opponent)

### Glossary of Terms
- **Auction draft**: Each franchise has a budget to bid on players
- **PPR**: Points per reception. In true PPR, 1 point for each reception and 0.5 points per completion. We halve those.
- **Potential points**: This is determined by league software and is as if the franchise owner set optimal lineup each week. No special consideration will be given for thingsl ike taxi squad (whatever league software does is "right")
- **Third-round reversal draft**: if you have 10 teams, pick 1 gets picl 1.01, 2.10, 3.10, 4.01, and 5.10 (eg, a snake draft that reverses direction after the second round/before the third round)

### FAQ
Q: Chris, I realy loved franchise tags. What happened to them?

A: (1) Liar. (2) Just trade your first for the player before the trade deadline and [transtion tag](#transition-tags) them, then.

-----
Q: What about extending contracts when we promote players from taxi squads?

A: Just extend like normal.

-----
Q: Stealing players from a taxi squad is expensive! Can't you make it cheaper?

A: Trade for them, then.

-----
Q: This whole free-agent slow bid is weird and different than everything else. What the hell?

A: Yep. I hear ya. Lot of things different in this league. You can do it!

-----
Q: What this "Average salary is calculate on contracts as they exist exiting the free agent draft" business?

A: TBD if it's more work, but it seems like we need an official cutoff for this. And immediately following the free agent draft (whether calculated then or, more likely, recreated) means you can't sign Gronk to an $800 contract at the end of the season to sabotage the TE market. Sure, sure, you can still draft him for $800, but then it's not a surprise to anyone as the season wraps. You do you.

-----
Q: Why can we only add players to taxi squads through the rookie draft and trading for players already on a taxi squad? It was different before!

A: Keep it simple.
