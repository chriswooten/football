## Schedule
* Playoffs start in week 15 (no earlier, at least, to avoid bye weeks)

## League Setup
1. If a team wins the championship 3 years in a row, pay out the empire pot and reset the league
   a. Alternatively, dispersal draft? Winning team goes into a pool and any team that wants to reset can join that pool. This clearly doesn't work with money assigned to contracts.
   b. Could go to a vote?
   c. Could be 3 times, period. Or reset that "3 times period" periodically. Or twice in a row. Or some combination thereof.

## Replacement Owners


## Nutshell
* 10 teams
* 30 roster spots
* 5 taxi squad spots
* 0.5 point PPR / 4 point passing TDs
* Best ball???

## Scoring
* 4 points per passing TD
* 0.05 points per passing yard
* 0.25 points per pass completion
* -2 points per interception thrown
* -1 point for being sacked
* 1 point per passing 2 point conversion
* 6 points per rushing TD
* 0.1 points per rushing yard
* 2 points per rushing 2 point conversion
* 6 points per receiving TD
* 0.1 points per receiving yard
* 0.5 points per reception
* 2 points per receiving 2 point conversion
* -0.5 points per fumble
* -1.5 points per fumble lost (to opponent)

## Excruciating Detail
### Rookie Draft
* League champion gets the last (tenth) (10th) draft pick in each round.
* League runner up gets the ninth (9th) draft pick in each round.
* Third place team gets the eighth (8th) draft pick in each round.
* Fourth place team gets the seventh (7th) draft pick in each round.
* Fifth place team gets the sixth (6th) draft pick in each round.
* Sixth place team gets the fifth (5th) draft pick in each round.
* Of non-playoff teams, team with the most potential points gets the fourth (4th) draft pick in each round.
* Of non-playoff teams, team with the second-to-most potential points gets the third (3rd) draft pick in each round.
* Of non-playoff teams, team with the second-fewest potential points gets the second (2nd) draft pick in each round.
* Of non-playoff teams, team with the fewest potential points gets the first (1st) draft pick in each round.
* Note, team picks may have been traded to other teams before the order is determined. The draft position of the original owner of that pick is transferred with the pick.
  * Eg, at the start of the 2023 season, Team A trades their 2024 first for Team B's 2024 first. Team A goes on to win the league. Team B wins zero games and has the fewest potential points. Assuming no other trades, Team A is drafting at 1.01 and 2.10, etc, while Team B is drafting at 1.10 and 2.01, etc.   
* Based on 6 team playofss. Maybe 4 is better? Probably not? With 4, nobody is playing in a money-less game, but I don't really remember that being a problem.
