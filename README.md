# F.O.O.T.B.A.L.L. II C.O.N.S.T.I.T.U.T.I.O.N.
Thank you for your interest in the Franchise Owner's Organization to Battle America's Lackadaisical Leagues II and welcome to our Codified Ordinance Noting Simple Traditions Intelligently Transcribed Utilizing Tautological Intrinsic Outlandish Nomenclature.

## Summary
This will attempt to summarize rules. If the summary does not agree with the detailed information in the appendix, the appendix is correct.

### Startup
1. Rookie draft determined randomly and will be third-round reversal draft. See [Startup Rookie Draft](#startup-rookie-draft)
2. Free agent draft will be auction draft and take place live for 10 rounds and then proceed online, blind bidding on up to 10 players per day.

### Rookie Draft
1. Draft order determind by final standings of previous season (See [Rookie Draft Pick Orders](#rookie-draft-pick-orders)):
   - For 1, 2, 3, and 4 finishers, winner assigned pick 10, runner up pick 9, etc.
   - For 5 and 6 place finishers, highest potential points assigned pick 6 and other assigned pick 5.
   - For everyone else, most potential points assigned pick 4, etc.
2. Prices will be determined based on draft order. See [Rookie Draft Prices](#rookie-draft-prices)

### Transition Tags
 - Each team may assign a transition tag to up to 2 players each season
 - Players receiving a transtion tag must have a contract ending before the next season and must have been on the team's roster to end the regular season
 - Owners must declare transition tags before 3/1 and may reverse their decision before 3/1
 - Players designated for a transition tag will receive a 1 year contract and must become free agents after that 1 year
 - Costs determined as the [average of the highest paid players at their position](#position-tiers) or current salary + 10% - whichever is higher.

### Holdouts
 - Players may not holdout if:
   - They are a rookie on the first or second year of their contract
   - They are on the first year of a four year contract
   - They are on the first or second year of a five your contract
 - Players that may hold out will if, at the end of the complete fantasy season (through the championship game), they finish in the [top tier of their position](#position-tiers) (this means scoring more points than the average of those top tiers) and they are paid less than 50% of the average salary for the players paid in the [top tier of their position](#position-tiers).
 - Players who holdout must be (1) cut, suffering normal contract penalties based on their previous contract or (2) have their salary increased to 75% of the average for the players paid in the [top tier of their position](#position-tiers).

### Taxi Squad
1. Players acquired during the rookie draft are automatically assigned a 3 year contract and placed on the team's taxi squad
2. Players on a taxi squad only have 25% of their salary count toward the team's salary cap (eg, a $60 players costs $15)
3. Within one week of the free agent draft, teams must reduce their taxi squad to no more than 5 players. This can be done through cuts or activations.
4. Players on the taxi squad may be cut for no penalty.
5. Taxi squad players may be stolen. There will be a message board post for this with details on how to initiate activating a player from someone else's taxi squad. The cost is 2 picks - one must come from the same round the player was drafted in, or better, and the other must come from a better round (eg, you can't steal a first round pick. A second round pick costs a first and a second or two firsts)

### Injured Reserve
 * Each team has 4 injured reseve slots.
 * Players that the league software allows to be placed on IR (likely OUT, SUSPENDED, and IR).
 * Players placed on IR must remain on IR for at least 28 days.
 * Only 25% of a player's salary counts against the current season salary cap while they remain on IR
   * Returning from IR or dropping the player has the salary return to normal

### Rosters
 * Teams have 25 roster spots
 * Starting rosters are 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, and 3 FLEX
 * In addition to the 25 roster spots, teams have 4 [Injured Reserve](#injured-reserve) spots and 5 [Taxi Squad](#taxi-squad) spots


### Scoring
Pretty standard 0.5 PPR. See [scoring details](#scoring-details)

### Waivers
 * Teams may use their unspent salary for blind bidding on free-agents during waivers
 * Link to leaague software's waiver bidding will be made available or it will be described here and distributed to the league.
 * FAAB claims will be processed every Thursday morning at 3 AM Central and every Sunday morning at 3 AM Central
 * Free agents are always on waivers except while processing waiver bids
 * Players acquired from waivers 

### Bureaucracy
#### Commissioner
1. At the beginning of each season, the commissioner will be held over from the previous season.
2. During the season, the commissioner will be responsible to efficiently run the day-to-day operations of the league and will be required to interpret the appropriate course of action based on the terms outlined in the league Constitution and the league software.
#### Triumvirate
#### Amendments

### Special Considerations
1. If a game is not finished similar to 2022's Buffalo / Cincinnati game in week 17, we will defer to the league software's ruling. If that is not conclusive, we will defer to the NFL's ruling. If that is not conclusive, the game will be a draw.

## Appendix

### Startup Rookie Draft
 - A random number, 1-10 will be assigned to each team. Team 1 gets to determine their pick position first, then Team 2, etc. **These are not franchise numbers assigned based on order teams join the league**
   - Each team has a day to determine their pick order. If they don't, then they will be assigned the earliest pick available and then we will move on to the next team.
     - Eg, if Team 1 decides they want pick 10 (so they get 1.10, 2.01, 3.01, 4.10, and 5.01) on Monday, then Team 2 has all day Tuesday to decide. If they don't choose, then they get pick 1. If they do choose pick 1 on Monday, then Team 3 has all day Tuesday to decide. If they don't choose before Wednesday, then they would get pick 2
     - The first day for this selection will be decided after the order is chosen. There will be at least 24 hours for Team 1 to decide.
 - Third-round-reversal is like a snake draft, but changes direction after round 2 / before round 3. More specifically, if we pick in order of Team 1 - Team 10:

   | Round | Pick 1  | Pick 2 | Pick 3 | Pick 4 | Pick 5 | Pick 6 | Pick 7 | Pick 8 | Pick 9 | Pick 10 |
   |-------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
   | 1     | Team 1  | Team 2 | Team 3 | Team 4 | Team 5 | Team 6 | Team 7 | Team 8 | Team 9 | Team 10 |
   | 2     | Team 10 | Team 9 | Team 8 | Team 7 | Team 6 | Team 5 | Team 4 | Team 3 | Team 2 | Team 1  |
   | 3     | Team 10 | Team 9 | Team 8 | Team 7 | Team 6 | Team 5 | Team 4 | Team 3 | Team 2 | Team 1  |
   | 4     | Team 1  | Team 2 | Team 3 | Team 4 | Team 5 | Team 6 | Team 7 | Team 8 | Team 9 | Team 10 |
   | 5     | Team 10 | Team 9 | Team 8 | Team 7 | Team 6 | Team 5 | Team 4 | Team 3 | Team 2 | Team 1  |

### Rookie Draft Pick Orders
 - 1st place is assigned pick 10 in the next season
 - 2nd place is assigned pick 9 in the next season
 - 3rd place is assigned pick 8 in the next season
 - 4th place is assigned pick 7 in the next season
 - 5th and 6th place are assigned picks 5 and 6. Team with highest potential points is assigned pick 6 while the other team is assigned pick 5
 - Everyone else is assigned picks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Team with highest potential points is assigned pick 4, next highest is assigned pick 3, next highest is assigned pick 2, and fewest is assigned pick 1.

### Rookie Draft Prices
| Round | Pick 1 | Pick 2 | Pick 3 | Pick 4 | Pick 5 | Pick 6 | Pick 7 | Pick 8 | Pick 9 | Pick 10 |
|-------|------- |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1     | $60    | $50    | $50    | $50    | $40    | $35    | $35    | $30   | $30     | $30     |

| 5     | $1     | $1     | $1     | $1     | $1     | $1     | $1     | $1    | $1      | $1      |
    
### Position Tiers
 - This is used for determining average points or average salaires as apporpiate. Eg, if Aaron Rodgers was paid $500 and he was the highest paid quarterback and didn't play at all, he would count in the top 5 for salary and not in the top 5 for points.

   | Tier   | Position(s) |
   |--------|-------------|
   | Top 5  | QB, TE      |
   | Top 7  | RB          |
   | Top 10 | WR          |

### Scoring Details
 * 4 points per passing TD
 * 0.05 points per passing yard
 * 0.25 points per pass completion
 * -2 points per interception thrown
 * -1 point for being sacked
 * 1 point per passing 2 point conversion
 * 6 points per rushing TD
 * 0.1 points per rushing yard
 * 2 points per rushing 2 point conversion
 * 6 points per receiving TD
 * 0.1 points per receiving yard
 * 0.5 points per reception
 * 2 points per receiving 2 point conversion
 * -0.5 points per fumble
 * -1.5 points per fumble lost (to opponent)

### Glossary of Terms
- **Auction draft**: Each franchise has a budget to bid on players
- **PPR**: Points per reception. In true PPR, 1 point for each reception and 0.5 points per completion. We halve those.
- **Potential points**: This is determined by league software and is as if the franchise owner set optimal lineup each week. No special consideration will be given for thingsl ike taxi squad (whatever league software does is "right")
- **Third-round reversal draft**: if you have 10 teams, pick 1 gets picl 1.01, 2.10, 3.10, 4.01, and 5.10 (eg, a snake draft that reverses direction after the second round/before the third round)

### Notes
 - Central time will be used for all cutoffs that aren't maintained by the league software
